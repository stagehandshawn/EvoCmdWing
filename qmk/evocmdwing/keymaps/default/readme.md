# The default keymap for kinesis-advantage
#

# The contents of this folder are not to be compiled in vscode here
# they are the files needed to use qmk cli tools to complie the custom keyboard onto a teensy 4.0
# if you take this keymap you can create one of your own on a different mcu
# teensy 4.0 is overkill for this project
